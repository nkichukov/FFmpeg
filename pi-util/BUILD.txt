Building Pi FFmpeg
==================

Configuration:
=============

These instructions work for cross compiles from Ubuntu 16.04 & Ubuntu
18.04. I would expect most other linux environments to work but I haven't
tried them.

pi-util/conf_pi2.sh

contains suitable options to build the code for Pi2/3.  It expects to find
git clones of

https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools
https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware

in the parent of the FFmpeg directory.  I recommend using --depth 1 to avoid a
lot of history you don't want.

If you have a copy of qasm.py in ../local/bin then the .qasm sources will be
rebuilt.  Otherwise the prebuilt .c & .h files will be used.
Likewise ../local/bin/vasmvidcore_std will enable VPU code rebuild

pi-util/conf_p1.sh should configure for Pi1.  Beware that as of this time
H265 QPU acceleration is broken on Pi1 and so it is disabled.
